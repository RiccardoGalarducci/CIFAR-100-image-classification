# CIFAR-100 Image Classification

This repository contains the **Learning from Unstructured Data project** developed during the Erasmus program at Nova FCT in Lisbon in Big Data Analytics and Engineering.

## Description

The aim of the project is to compare Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to afford a multi-class classification problem on [CIFAR-100](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset with coarse labels. The implementation of the networks are done using the Sequential Model of Tensorflow/Keras. 


## Repository Overview

In this repository, in the root level, you can find the jupyter notebook where the assignemnt is solved.
